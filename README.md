# TMarcher

> a fun project and a proof of concept that you can everything in terminal!

## Showcase
TODO still lol

## Compilation



### linux

> prerequisites:
> g++
> make

after cloning this repository by whatever means (either `git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/AMAIOLAMO/tmarcher.git` or through downloading the zip file)

then simply go into the directory by `cd tmarcher`

and do `make`

this should compile the final executable into the `build` directory


## How to use

for now the code is very NOT modular(yet), but you can type for the resolution of the rendering
and how much threads to dispatch for.
